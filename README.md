# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

- Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors.
- Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. 
- The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. 
- This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

# AiCore
- This is my 2nd AiCore project.

# Milestone 2

- Created a teachable machine folder that contains images that will help the code recognise the different signals.
- Update: Struggling with the model to run the code so created a new one.


# Milestone 3

- Created a virtual working environment using conda and installed required libraries.

# Milestone 4

- Created a manual RPS game where the user and the computer choose their option and the code decided the winner.

# Milestone 5

- Created a camera RPS game that captures the choice of the user and decided the winner by comparing it with the choice of the computer.
