# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

- Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors.
- Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. 
- The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. 
- This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

# AiCore
- This is the 2nd project of my AiCore Journey.

# What I learned

- Create a teachable machine model that recognises different hand signals for the game.
- Create a virtual working environment using conda and install required libraries.
- Create a manual RPS game where the user and the computer choose their option and the code decided the winner.
- Create a camera RPS game that captures the choice of the user and decided the winner by comparing it with the choice of the computer.
